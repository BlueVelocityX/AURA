# üå≥ Aura (The Caretaker) - Treehouse Hangout Bot

Aura is a specialized Discord bot designed to manage private, cozy, friends-only communities. Its focus is on providing subtle administrative support and interactive fun, rather than strict, public community enforcement. Aura handles security, logging, and metrics, ensuring your hangout remains a comfortable and safe space.

## ‚òï Core Philosophy

This bot is built for the "Treehouse Hangout" model:
* **Private First:** No public verification system is needed. Access is managed by the Host and Co-Hosts.
* **Cozy Moderation:** Administrative actions are framed as "Time-Outs" or "Barrings."
* **Interactive Presence:** Includes a generative AI feature (`!vibe`) to add flavor and atmosphere to the chat.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Atmosphere Setter (`!vibe`):** An interactive command powered by the Gemini API that generates short, relevant, and fun responses based on a user's topic to enhance the current chat mood.
* **Essential Security:** Includes an automated **Ban Evasion Check** upon member entry to ensure previously barred guests cannot silently return.
* **Simplified Flagging (`!flag`):** A discreet, easy-to-use command for any guest to report a concern privately to the Host/Co-Hosts.
* **Caretaker Log:** A web-based **Caretaker Log** (`/admin` dashboard) for the Host to view server metrics, activity, and the full moderation history (Guestbook).
* **Clean-Up Toolkit:** Core commands for Co-Hosts to handle spam and temporary disruptions (`!purge`, `!mute`, `!kick`).
